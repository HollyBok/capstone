Sorry for the messy repository!

All of the data collection is in the files labeled 'API', 'years in league', and 'Scraping Hoops Hype'

The DataFrame is put together in the "DataFrame merge" file and preliminary EDA is done in the 'EDA' file.

The 'Clustering' file has both KMeans clustering and DBSCAN and a clusters column is added to my DataFrame

The modeling that I have done so far is in the "Regression" file


My models are performing okay, so what I am going to do next is try Polynomial features and PCA and see how that changes the models
I also want to mess with my hyperparameters a lot more in the regression models to see if I can get some better results.
